# ars's ER-301 playground

For now it's just *msproc* — a utility that lets you control stereo width by converting the stereo signal to M/S, 
adjusting M and S levels and going back to stereo. 
I need it specifically for my Ciat Lonbarde Plumbutter — it tends to pan things hard left / right which is not always appropriate. 

Perhaps some will find it useful!

TODO:
*make an effect that would allow separate processing for M and S*
