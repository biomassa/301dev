For now it's just msproc — an utility that lets you control stereo width by converting the stereo signal to M/S, adjusting M and S levels and going back to stereo. 
I need it specifically for my Ciat Lonbarde Plumbutter — it tends to pan things hard left / right which is not always appropriate. Perhaps some will find it useful!
