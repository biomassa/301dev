# ars's ER-301 stuff

For now it's just *msproc* — a utility that lets you control stereo width by converting the stereo signal to M/S, 
adjusting M and S levels and going back to stereo. 
I need it specifically for my Ciat Lonbarde Plumbutter — it tends to pan things hard left / right which is not always appropriate. 

Perhaps some will find it useful!

Please refer to [this thread](https://forum.orthogonaldevices.com/t/using-faust-for-er-301-dsp-development/5890) for the tools and instructions on how to compile Faust code for  the ER-301. 
Thanks ljw!
